# NetScaler Management and Analytics (MAS) repository
Welcome to my NetScaler Management and Analytics (MAS) repository.

A repository to keep track of all NetScaler MAS scripts and custom Stylebooks I have created during my many adventures to automate NetScaler deployments and configurations.

Where another project/repository focuses on building a NITRO PowerShell module for NetScaler configurations, this repository is all about using NetScaler MAS as a centralized NetScaler management system.

This repository will contain the different custom NetScaler MAS Stylebooks I have created as well as the (sample) PowerShell scripts to support fully automated workflows for NetScaler deployments and configurations where MAS is your centralized management system.

So right now it holds the demo scripts from my Citrix Synergy and VirtualExpo presentations to give you a head start at building your own automated workflows for NetScaler MAS to centralize your NetScaler infrastructure management!

If you are looking for the Configuration Jobs that were shown during the presentations, please visit Carsten Bruns' GitHib repository at https://github.com/CarstenBruns/MASAutomation to ensure you get the latest versions of those files!
